     <h2>Experience</h2>
     <p>While I may not yet have direct experience working in web development, I have previously acquired a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Tennessee, an Associate's Degree from Roane State Community College, and I have four years experience working in out-patient physical therapy. </p>   
    <p>Recently my passion for technology and challenging myself has been reignited, and I cannot wait to continue to push myself toward my life-long goal of working in tech.</p>
    <p>I will continue to develop my skills in HTML and CSS, before pushing into new areas, all while coming back to update and improve my profile page. Please check back to follow along with my progress!</p>
